# code-cite

This project started at Springer Nature Hackday in November 2017.

The goal is to investigate how often code is cited in academic publications.

It was inspired by Yo Yehudi's [Code is Science](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/) project and seeks to complement the work by that community by providing some numbers associated with the prevalence of code citations in the published literature.
