# Code (and Data) Cite

This project started at [Springer Nature Hackday](https://www.springernature.com/gb/researchers/campaigns/sn-hack-day) in November 2017 and continued at the [Collaborations Workshop Hackday](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw18/) in March 2018.

The goal is to investigate how often code and data are cited in academic publications.

It was inspired by [Yo Yehudi's](https://github.com/yochannah) [Code is Science](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/) project and seeks to complement the work by that community by providing some numbers associated with the prevalence of code citations in the published literature.

### Secrets

Some scripts may require the use of secrets you don't want to be stored in this public
Github repository (e.g. web service API keys). You can create a "secrets" folder
in the top level of this repository to store these. This "secrets" folder and
all comments will be ignored by Git.
